0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Group project
Python
OOP

Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object.

Files and Directories
models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
tests directory will contain all unit tests.
console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
methods: save() and to_json()
models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
Storage
Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:

Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
Provide default value of any attribute
In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage

How can I store my instances?
That’s a good question. So let’s take a look at this code:

class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = []
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
Here, I’m creating a student and store it in a list. But after this program execution, my Student instance doesn’t exist anymore.

class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
save(students) # save all Student objects to a file
Nice!

But how it works?

First, let’s look at save(students):

Can I write each Student object to a file => NO, it will be the memory representation of the object. For another program execution, this memory representation can’t be reloaded.
Can I write each Student.name to a file => YES, but imagine you have other attributes to describe Student? It would start to be become too complex.
The best solution is to convert this list of Student objects to a JSON representation.

Why JSON? Because it’s a standard representation of object. It allows us to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly to be understood by another language/program.

Example:

My Python program creates Student objects and saves them to a JSON file
Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate its own Student class/representation
And the reload()? now you know the file is a JSON file representing all Student objects. So reload() has to read the file, parse the JSON string, and re-create Student objects based on this data-structure.

File storage == JSON serialization
For this first step, you have to write in a file all your objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and restore them when you start it. You can’t store and restore a Python instance of a class as “Bytes”, the only way is to convert it to a serializable data structure:

convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method my_instance.to_json() to retrieve a dictionary
convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be YAML, XML, CSV…) - for us it will be a my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)
write this string to a file on disk
And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:

read a string from a file on disk
convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON representation, so it’s easy to convert - for us it will be a my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)
convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)
*args, **kwargs
How To Use them

How do you pass arguments to a function?

def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
But with this function definition, you must call my_fct with 2 parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
What? What’s *args and **kwargs?

*args is a Tuple that contains all arguments
*kwargs is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value
A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, *args is the list of anonymous arguments, no name, just an order. **kwargs is the dictionary with all named arguments.

Examples:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

my_fct() # () - {}
my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
Perfect? Of course you can mix both, but the order should be first all anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}
You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how your variables are stored.

datetime
datetime is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc…

In this example, you create an instance of datetime with the current date and time:

from datetime import datetime

date_now = datetime.now()
print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922
date_now is an object, so you can manipulate it:

from datetime import timedelta

date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
print(date_tomorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922
… you can also store it:

a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}
What? What’s this format when a datetime instance is in a datastructure??? It’s unreadable.

How to make it readable: strftime

print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
